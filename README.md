# cufinals

**cufinals** is a Go package which can download, parse, and search Cornell's final exam schedule.

# How it works

I parse the final schedule from [https://registrar.cornell.edu/Sched/EXFA.html](https://registrar.cornell.edu/Sched/EXFA.html). Once I have this information, it is relatively trivial to mess around with it.
